# üß™ 3D PSA ‚Üí Permeability ‚Üí Web Portal

A three-step tutorial that starts with a **physics-based 3D polar surface area (PSA)** calculation, layers on a **machine-learning permeability model**, and ends with a **chemist-friendly Flask web app**.

## Why 3D PSA?

3D PSA measures the polar part of a molecule‚Äôs solvent-accessible surface. Unlike 2D TPSA, it captures **shielding, intramolecular H-bonds and folding‚Äîkey drivers of permeability in beyond-Lipinski space** (e.g. macrocycles, PROTACs, peptides).

In similar work, M√∂bitz et al. generated 3D PSA by first producing conformers with OpenEye Omega and clustering them with RDKit. Each representative conformer then underwent a single-point COSMO QM calculation, after which the polar surface area was obtained by summing the solvent-accessible surface where the atomic charge density exceeded |q| > 0.002 e √Ö‚Åª¬≤. These 3D-PSA values were subsequently used to train a permeability model on 114 proprietary beyond-Rule-of-5 compounds.

Additionally, Lawrenz et al. employed a Schr√∂dinger QM workflow in which single-point calculations were carried out both in gas phase and with an implicit-solvent model. The difference between the two energies provided the 3D solvation energy, E-sol, which served as the key descriptor for a trained permeability model.

In this example, we will use the following method:

## üó∫ Roadmap

| Step | Script / Folder | What it does | 
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **1. SMILES ‚Üí conformers** | `gen_conf.py` | Use Open-source RDKit ETKDG to generate 10 low energy conformations per ligand.
| **2. Compute 3D PSA** | `compute_psa.py` | Two routes:<br>‚Ä¢ QikProp (Schr√∂dinger) ‚áí 3D PSA<br>‚Ä¢ Open-source (RDKit UFF ‚Üí SASA triangulation) |
| **3. Train ML model** | `train_mdck_model.py` | Gradient-Boost regressor that predicts **MDCK permeability** from 3D PSA, in our example using a set of 328 cyclic peptides from http://cycpeptmpdb.com |
| **4. Build web portal** | `app.py`, `templates/`, `static/` | Flask app: paste a SMILES in server to return predicted 3D PSA and MDCK Papp in <1 second. |
